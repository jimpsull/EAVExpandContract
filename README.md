# EAVExpandContract
Take a source EAV table, expand to a traditional schema table, contract back to eav

I'd like to do this in Python (or know if there is already a library for doing so)
But VBA was easier for me.  All the important code is in module1.

I have since come back and converted the routine to Python.  I am now in the process of seeing if I can package it to PyPI.
